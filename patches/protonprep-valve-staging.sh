    # NOTE: Some patches are applied manually because they -do- apply, just not cleanly, ie with patch fuzz.

    # winex11-MWM_Decorations - not compatible with fullscreen hack

    # server-Stored_ACLs - requires ntdll-Junction_Points
    # server-File_Permissions - requires ntdll-Junction_Pointsv
    # kernel32-CopyFileEx - breaks various installers
    # dbghelp-Debug_Symbols - Ubisoft Connect games (3/3 I had installed and could test) will crash inside pe_load_debug_info function with this enabled
    # mmsystem.dll16-MIDIHDR_Refcount - triggers Werror
    # vcomp_for_dynamic_init_i8 - triggers Werror
    # winex11-ime-check-thread-data - triggers Werror
    # winex11-Fixed-scancodes - needs winex11-ime-check-thread-data
