# Wine-Wineland child-process rendering

This directory contains a selective rebase of Wine-Wineland's cross-process
DMA-BUF rendering work onto the Wine base used by GE-Proton.

Upstream branch:
https://github.com/nanomatters/wine-wineland/tree/wineland_20260713-reorg

Original author: Erhan Bilgili <erhan.bilgili@gmail.com>

The original author and dates are preserved in every patch's mail header, and
every imported commit carries a `Source:` trailer with its upstream link. The
patches were rebased only where the GE-Proton Wine base had diverged. The first
subject was narrowed to describe the imported rendering portion of an upstream
commit that also bundled SNI work.

GE-Proton's existing SNI implementation is applied before this series. The
older bundled SNI implementation and Wine-Wineland's native Steam-overlay work
are not imported. References to child "overlays" inside this series mean GDI
child-window composition, not the Steam overlay. Direct-toplevel presentation
and other unrelated Wine-Wineland work are also intentionally excluded.

The 85 numbered patches selectively cover the source commits below. Most
pending-producer changes from `64f5e7717f44` are folded into the following
expose-order patch after rebasing; patch 0067 restores its managed Vulkan
producer lifecycle, which must bracket image allocation and channel teardown.
Patch 0068 adds consumer-state tracking and nonblocking managed dma-buf
publishing from `129fa64fc449` without its unrelated minimized-window changes.
Patch 0075 is a GE-Proton follow-up that retires an OpenGL frame callback when
its client surface is detached or reattached, preventing pre-attachment CEF
presents from permanently throttling the attached surface.
Patch 0076 adapts the OpenGL presentation-suspension behavior from
`aa3013f4bfcb` by deferring ordinary EGL swaps until their client surface is
attached to a live toplevel; roleless HWND dma-buf producers remain active.
Patch 0077 enables Wine's manual frame-callback throttle only when disabling
EGL's native swap throttling succeeds, and reports actual EGL swap failures.
Patch 0078 recreates an EGL window surface after its client wl_surface changes
between roleless and subsurface presentation, recovering drivers that return
`EGL_BAD_SURFACE` after that transition.
Patch 0079 mirrors Wine's X11 EGL fallback-context handling for applications
that release their WGL context before calling `SwapBuffers`, preventing Mesa
from rejecting Chromium child-window presents with `EGL_BAD_CONTEXT` and
`EGL_BAD_SURFACE`. It is based on Wine commit `de44bd7234b2c` by Paul Gofman.
Patch 0084 adapts `093181906443` by attaching an active replacement WSI surface
before its first present while retaining the selected surface's last frame.
The imported tree now has the attachment-generation support that was missing
when this commit was first evaluated, so the focused replacement handoff is
portable without the later presentation-coordination rewrite.
`a42482e82bcb` is omitted because its deadlock fix is already present in the
rebased implementation. The portions of `a022197bcbd4` that overlap
GE-Proton's separately applied NVIDIA Reflex patch are restored by patch 0065,
and patch 0066 imports the required present-wait dispatch follow-up by Etaash
Mathamsetty.

## Wine / EM-11 rebase (2026-09-09)

Rebased onto Wine `542ca26b64ed` plus EM-11 `5a1ae24b090b`. Original
Wine-Wineland author headers and `Source:` references remain intact.
See `../wine-wayland/README.md` for the complete import and validation notes.

The combined implementation preserves EM's output enter/leave listeners,
output-reference list, and activation API while retaining cross-process
composition. A queued Win32 geometry/state update takes precedence over a
new output-placement hint. Patch 0055 invalidates cached limits only inside
EM's new committed/window-state change conditional. Patch 0029 retains the
exact-aligned popup fallback after EM's separate above/left owner probes.

The clipping patches no longer carry context that would restore the old
implicit `attach_thread_input` behavior removed from Wine's parent-change
path. The optional window-move-hack removal remains owned by patch 0073;
the equivalent new EM revert is kept in `../disabled/`.

No Wine-Wineland Steam-overlay code was added in this rebase. GE's current
overlay integration, presentation-ownership fixes, and Unix-only dispatcher
remain in use. Patch application was validated in an isolated tree; this
does not substitute for build or runtime validation.

## Re-sync onto `wineland_20260713-reorg` (2026-09-01)

22 upstream commits newer than `129fa64fc449` were imported as real
cherry-picks, and the series was renumbered into contiguous `0001`-`0079`
order so that the applied order keeps matching upstream DAG order. Imported
commits, in patch order:

```
0032 c2cca42e16ed  win32u: Avoid extra server call in GetWindowPlacement.
0033 fb569856df6c  win32u: Avoid full hit-test list for mouse tracking.
0034 362e518332ca  server: Avoid unchanged key state serial bumps.
0035 1d434f8af887  server: Avoid heap allocation for small hit-test lists.
0036 d49d421995d6  winewayland: Avoid win_data lookup in set_clip.
0037 7d3c16911a81  winewayland: Keep minimized toplevels mapped.
0038 425b914f8b9b  winewayland: Defer minimized restore until foreground handling.
0045 f70d57bb55d3  winewayland: Keep toplevels mapped during transient visibility changes.
0055 b1bf835bd15d  winewayland: Invalidate cached toplevel size limits.
0056 c4c40fc0febd  winewayland: Finalize processed configures without GDI contents.
0057 f29ef3325862  winewayland: Avoid scaling configure sizes twice.
0058 f84f09ec1ae1  win32u, winewayland: Handle collapsed-caption windows.
0059 37b786b5186d  win32u: Handle maximized collapsed-caption windows.
0060 31a9b2d84a37  win32u, winewayland: Fix maximized frameless window geometry.
0061 42eeaa2e477d  winewayland: Avoid double-counting server decorations.
0062 d2ba92e09faa  winewayland: Restore maximized windows on zero-size configures.
0069 cd4699994c7a  winewayland: Unmap hidden toplevels.
0070 1a4335fd0e14  win32u, winewayland: Preserve fullscreen swapchain image enumeration.
0071 0a255528b206  winewayland.drv: Avoid frame changes for fullscreen configures.
0072 848dd9933fac  win32u: Refresh display topology after monitor changes.
0073 6451d1cf979c  win32u: Remove the optional window move hack.
0074 b68a41a9025a  winewayland.drv: Keep client-rendered popups mapped.
```

Patch 0045 replaces the older local adaptation (previously 0038) with the
upstream commit `f70d57bb55d3`. Patch 0069 (`cd4699994c7a`, "winewayland: Unmap
hidden toplevels") prevents an explicitly hidden launcher window from
remaining mapped and taking focus away from the game window.

Adaptations made while importing:

- Patch 0056 (`c4c40fc0febd`) keeps this base's local `wl_surface_commit()`
  idiom; the `wayland_surface_commit_pending_state()` helper does not exist
  here.
- Patch 0058 (`f84f09ec1ae1`) reads the win32u `__wine_win32u_frameless` window
  property instead of a cached `data->frameless` field, which this base does
  not have.
- Patch 0069 (`cd4699994c7a`) keeps the `swp_flags` parameter of
  `wayland_win_data_create_wayland_surface()`, because GE-Proton's tray-menu
  and fullscreen-hide handling still needs it.
- Patch 0070 (`1a4335fd0e14`) imports only the `vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR` half;
  the fullscreen-request half needs `struct wayland_fullscreen_request`
  tracking, which this base does not have.
- Patch 0068 was rebased: one hunk in `wayland_surface_update_hwnd_dmabufs()`
  moved behind the imported minimized-toplevel early return.
- `../em-fixups/0009-winewayland-do-not-double-scale-toplevel-configures.patch`
  was dropped: it duplicates upstream `f29ef3325862`, now patch 0057.
- `../em-fixups/0019-...preserve-fullscreen-clients-across-transient-hide.patch`
  was rebased onto patch 0069, which deletes the keep-mapped-on-hide helper it
  used to narrow. The same intent is now expressed as a fullscreen-renderer
  exception on the hide path, so minimized windows and non-rendering windows
  such as launchers unmap again.
- `../em-fixups/` patches 0013, 0014, 0016 and 0022 were re-emitted against the
  new tree so they keep applying without fuzz.

## Bug fixes ported from the skipped set (2026-09-01)

Six of the probed commits became portable once their hunks were re-derived
against the tree GE-Proton actually has at each apply step. They are real
cherry-picks with the upstream author, date and `Source:` trailer preserved:

```
0080 da79178bb865  win32u: Ignore empty Vulkan presentation geometry.
0081 b8496ab03011  winewayland: Derive toplevel resizeability from window state.
0082 1261111b60ec  win32u: Fall back to linear dma-buf images.
0083 19d4bf0c51eb  win32u: Request an extra Vulkan swapchain image.
0084 093181906443  winewayland.drv: Attach replacement surfaces before first present.
../em-fixups/0023 b9638444e73d  winewayland.drv: Clear carrier state when replacing contents.
```

## GE-Proton local fixups (2026-09-02)

Patch 0085 is not part of the upstream import; it is a GE-Proton follow-up
for the fast path introduced by patch 0021. Acking a fullscreen configure
from the requested state bypasses `wayland_configure_window()`, so an
application that strips its frame styles before entering the state can keep
stale frame insets in the Win32 client rect. This matches the failed display
mode transitions reported for Black Desert Online in GE issue 721. 0085 asks
the window thread to refresh the client rect with a geometry-neutral
frame-changed `SetWindowPos`. It only acts on a live, non-minimized,
borderless window that remains in the true Wayland fullscreen state and whose
live Win32 client dimensions do not match its live window dimensions.

`../em-fixups/0024` is a focused backport of Erhan Bilgili's presentation
lifecycle work from `8878f044c1b0`, `88b19ffdd44b`, `a9ce7e02fe50`, and
`48bf29c49f2b`. It tracks a minimal presentation generation, invalidates it
when a Wayland client subsurface is detached, polls host present waits in
bounded slices, and returns `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` after a three-second
visible-surface feedback stall. It also avoids no-op parent commits after
desynchronized client presents. This supplies bounded recovery for a stalled
presenter without a repaint request or executable-specific behavior. The
direct-toplevel and host-surface retirement portions remain excluded.

`../em-fixups/0026` is a focused adaptation of Erhan Bilgili's
`13bb88cb72c8` presenter-coordination work. It records every native graphics
client targeting an HWND and supplies the per-window bookkeeping used by later
fixups. Keeping every native presenter attached proved insufficient for Purple:
its DXVK D3D9Ex path uses immediate presentation and can block indefinitely in
`vkAcquireNextImageKHR` on an obsolete host WSI stream.

`../em-fixups/0027` completes the relevant ownership behavior from
`13bb88cb72c8`. It selects the newest active graphics-surface generation,
invalidates prior generations on ownership changes, and backs non-owning
Vulkan presenters with locally retired images instead of another host Wayland
WSI surface. Host image acquisition is polled in bounded slices so an already
blocked presenter observes ownership invalidation. A separate pending-native
reference keeps only the replacement surface attached while host Wayland WSI
creates its swapchain, then hands attachment ownership to the active native
reference. This avoids the circular create-before-attach stall without
reattaching locally retired or cross-process managed swapchains. The fix has no
synthetic repaints, resize nudges, or executable-specific path. The full
virtual presentation-timing and direct-toplevel portions remain excluded.

`../em-fixups/0030` through `0035` import the Unix-only system-thread support
by Alexandre Julliard and M0n7y5. `../em-fixups/0036` is the GE-Proton
integration that creates Wine-Wayland's process-global event dispatcher as a
system thread. Such a thread is omitted from Win32 process/thread enumeration,
cannot receive a user thread context or APC, and does not emit debug events.
This prevents protected child processes such as Lineage II from identifying
and terminating the dispatcher, which otherwise leaves their xdg surfaces
waiting forever for an initial configure. The dispatcher still has a normal
Wine TEB and architecture-specific signal handling on x86, x86-64, and ARM64.
`../em-fixups/0037` completes process teardown for that integration: when the
last user thread exits, the server terminates the remaining process-local
system threads before running normal last-thread cleanup. Without it, games
that exit without explicitly calling `RtlExitUserProcess` can leave their
`.bin` process and audio alive behind the hidden dispatcher.

Adaptations made while importing:

- Patch 0080 (`da79178bb865`) imports the empty-geometry guards only. The
  upstream `surface_get_fshack_config()` hunk has no counterpart here: this base
  uses `surface_get_fshack_dpi()` and has no fshack swapchain config cache.
- Patch 0081 (`b8496ab03011`) computes the classification inside
  `wayland_win_data_get_config()` from the style that function already reads,
  because this base caches neither `data->style` nor a present rect. The now
  unused `data->resizeable` field is removed together with it.
- Patch 0082 (`1261111b60ec`) keeps `caps_flags` before the modifier arrays in
  `vk_select_managed_modifiers()` and has no managed-swapchain color space or
  consumer wake eventfd, so the layout plumbing was inserted around those
  differences. `managed_create_image()` is otherwise identical to upstream.
  It also adds `#include <limits.h>`, which upstream has in this file but this
  base does not: the new `UINT_MAX` stride guard does not compile without it
  under `-Werror`.
- Patch 0083 (`19d4bf0c51eb`) adds only the image-count adjustment; the insertion
  point here has no `compositor_scaling` lookup.
- `b9638444e73d` became `../em-fixups/0023-winewaylanddrv-Clear-carrier-state-when-replacing-conte.patch`
  rather than a patch in this directory. Its subject is carrier bookkeeping, and
  `../em-fixups/0013` renames `transparent_carrier_*` to `carrier_*` and adds
  `carrier_opaque`; before that fixup the stale-opacity bug cannot occur, and in
  the middle of this series the upstream hunks have no context to apply to. The
  direct-toplevel promotion hunks were dropped as elsewhere.
- `../em-fixups/` patches 0011 and 0013 were re-emitted with context-only
  changes, because patch 0081 rewrites `wayland_win_data_get_config()` and both
  of them patch that function.

Apply order is what decides placement: `protonprep-valve-staging.sh` applies
`wine-wayland/`, then `em-fixups/0001`, then this directory, then the rest of
`em-fixups/`. A fix whose hunks depend on fixup content has to land after the
fixup loop instead of in the middle of this series.

## Skipped upstream commits

The commits below were probed and deliberately not imported; the fixes above
came out of this list once they were ported. Almost all of the remainder are
built on subsystems this Wine base predates: cached `win_data`
window state
(`data->style`, `exstyle`, `visible`, `toplevel`, `owner`, `restore_rect`,
`configure_state_serial`), direct-toplevel presentation (`direct_client`,
`evict_direct_client`, `presentation_scaling`), full active-wait and host
surface retirement tracking, fullscreen-request tracking, the
`output_info_array` rework, and client-presentation timing feedback. Getting
those fixes means re-syncing the whole series onto a newer upstream snapshot,
not cherry-picking onto this one.
